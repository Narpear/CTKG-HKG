Antibodies normally help the body to prevent infections. However, in this disorder, the antibodies turn against the body itself and especially against cells in the brain and disturb the normal brain function. They are therefore called autoantibodies.

There is no specific therapy for patients with autoimmune encephalitis so far. At the moment, the symptoms are treated with approved medications such as cortisone and immunotherapies also used in oncology. These therapies are unspecified and aim to reduce the number of autoantibodies and to contain the autoimmune process. In this trial we aim to test a new therapy option: in this therapy the body cells producing autoantibodies will be specifically targeted by a substance called bortezomib.

Despite a widely used antiviral treatment, the prognosis remains poor with a mortality of 5 to 20% and a considerable morbidity rate.

One of the contributing factors of bad prognosis is the development of encephalitis mediated by autoantibodies, most often directed against NMDA receptors, in the weeks following viral encephalitis.

Several autoantibodies (Ab) may be detected in AE, although its detection is not mandatory to establish a diagnosis. These Ab mainly recognize different synaptic and cell-surface proteins in the central nervous system, and are thought to be pathogenic as they alter the normal location or function of its antigens.

The primary trigger of the immune response is unknown for most of AE. In addition to acquired susceptibility, genetic predisposition may also be important in the pathogenesis of AE. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is the genetic factor most frequently associated with autoimmune diseases, due to its genetic complexity and key role in the adaptive immune response.

CASPR2 antibody-associated auto-immune encephalitides lead to an inflammation of the limbic system and generate focal temporal seizures and cognitive impairment. Most patients are initially hospitalized because of the temporal seizures (Joubert et al., JAMA Neurology 2016). However, many already show at that time cognitive impairment, which has failed to elicit the appropriate investigations, therefore delaying the diagnosis.

Autoimmune Encephalitis,NCT02905136,Mechanisms of Auto-immune Encephalitis,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02905136,COMPLETED,"Neurological and psychiatric diseases are one of the major health problems worldwide. Decades of fundamental and clinical research have led to the model that these disorders results from synaptic imbalance between excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory systems in key brain structures. Although the network and neurotransmitter systems involved have been delineated, the mechanisms leading to improper neurotransmissions remain poorly understood. One major limitation lays in the difficulty to transpose the identified dysregulation in humans to relevant animal models in which molecular and cellular targets can be manipulated.

The amino-acid glutamate mediates the vast majority of excitatory neurotransmission in the mammalian brain. We know that the glutamatergic synapses can change their strength by regulating surface expression and dynamics of their postsynaptic receptors, through changes in receptor recycling and/or lateral diffusion. This synaptic plasticity underlies higher cognitive functions such as learning and memory and is likely compromised in several disease states. Regulating glutamate receptor number and function is thus of primary importance. New subcellular imaging technique rendered possible the study of receptor trafficking and receptor regulation in various conditions including pathological models opening new fundamental questions. Moreover, recent breakthroughs on glutamate receptor structure offer unprecedented clues on the molecular and structural mechanisms underpinning receptor dysfunction at the atomic level.

Recently, description of encephalitis associated with specific autoantibodies (Abs) directed against neuronal synaptic receptors or proteins (NSA-Abs) opens new lights in the pathophysiological mechanisms of some human brain disorders. The best example and the most frequent syndrome is the synaptic autoimmune encephalitis associated with autoantibodies against extracellular domains of the glutamatergic NMDA receptor (NMDAR-Abs). Classically, patients first present psychiatric symptoms with hallucinations and bizarre behavior before development of neurological symptoms such as seizures, dyskinesia, and autonomic instability. Despite the severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms, more than 80% of patients fully recover after immunomodulatory treatments and many arguments suggest a direct role of NMDAR-Abs in the symptoms. The investigators recently demonstrated that NMDAR-Abs directly modify, at the synaptic level, NMDAR lateral diffusion by disruption of the interaction between NMDAR and EphrinB2 receptor, a synaptic protein anchoring NMDAR at the synapse (Mikasova et al, Brain 2012; Dupuis et al, EMBOJ 2014). These data suggest that NMDAR-Abs could directly participate in the neuropsychiatric disorders observed in patients and that NMDAR dysfunctions could be directly responsible for the observed symptoms. Furthermore, these data suggest that other NSA-Abs directed against other synaptic proteins could explain specific neurological symptoms in patients with encephalitis that are not associated with NMDAR-Abs.

The aim of MECANO is to combine multidisciplinary approaches (clinical, immunological, and neurobiological ones) to identify new NSA-Abs, to characterize their specific pathological roles and to decipher acute and chronic NMDAR-Abs effects on biophysical and structural properties of the NMDA receptor, synaptic plasticity, neuronal morphology, and cognitive performance. This project should provide key insights onto the effects of patients' NSA-Abs on the cellular dynamic and regulation of synaptic proteins or receptors and on the molecular cascades activated during synapse dysfunction. The investigators will investigate how NSA-Abs binding alter receptor activity, modify surface receptor mobility and dynamically regulate the maturation of synapses and circuitries. For that purpose, The investigators will use a unique combination of high-resolution imaging (single nanoparticle tracking), receptor engineering, cellular electrophysiology, computational (structural modeling) and cellular and molecular biology approaches and finally behaviour assays. Based on both cutting-edge neurobiology and clinical expertise of autoimmune disorders, and strengthened by promising preliminary experiments, the MECANO project will likely open new avenues of fundamental research in the understanding of synaptic dysfunction and clinical research for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",NO,Autoimmune Encephalitis,OTHER: Fundamental research,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,OBSERVATIONAL,"Institut NeuroMyoGÃ¨ne Ã‰quipe Synaptopathies et Autoanticorps (SynatAc) INSERM U1217 / UMR CNRS 5310, Bron, 69500, France",Jerome Honnorat,

Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome,NCT04708626,Epidemiology of Autoimmune Encephalitides and Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndromes in Sweden,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT04708626,COMPLETED,"Autoimmune encephalitis and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases caused by an abnormal immune response toward the nervous system. This can lead to life-threatening symptoms, but is in many cases treatable if a swift and correct diagnosis is made. Antibodies targeting neuronal proteins (i.e. ""neuronal antibodies"") can be detected in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in about half of the patients suffering from these conditions. Although an important part of the diagnostical process of these conditions, diagnosis cannot be made only based on a positive antibody test, but the clinical findings have to be compatible as well. As these conditions are so rare, clinicians might struggle to interpret antibody test results.

In this study the investigators aim to estimate the incidence rate of autoimmune encephalitides and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes in the Uppsala-Ã–rebro health care region in Sweden between the years 2015 and 2019. Medical records from patients belonging to the Uppsala-Ã–rebro health care region (a region in the middle of Sweden with a population of approximately 2.1 million), that tested positive for any neuronal antibody in serum or CSF will be studied to obtain clinical, laboratory and radiological data. This data will be used to ascertain if diagnostic criteria are fulfilled as well as to describe clinical characteristics and identifying possible comorbidities.",NO,Autoimmune Encephalitis|Paraneoplastic Neurological Syndrome,OTHER: Description and analysis|OTHER: Description and analysis,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",,OBSERVATIONAL,"Uppsala University, Uppsala, Uppland, 75237, Sweden",Joachim Burman|Anna Rostedt Punga,
