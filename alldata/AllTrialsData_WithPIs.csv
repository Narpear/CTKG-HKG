Among several voxels, for each fiber on the same x-axis (projection, association, and subcortical fibers), one voxel is selected that shows the most common orientation in each fiber. The DTI-ALPS index is the average of two sets of diffusivity values perpendicular to the dominant fibers in the tissue, namely the x-axis diffusivity in the area of projection fibers (Dxproj) and the x-axis diffusivity in the area of association fibers (Dxassoc), the y-axis diffusivity in the area of projection fibers (Dyproj) and the area of association fibers.

This test therefore results in 20 binary measures, which can be separated according to the type of scenario.
 
 In this task, for each vignette, the type of choice made is measured, along with levels of moral permissibility, subjective emotional reactivity and moral relativity.
 
 For this scale:
 
 Type of choice: binary yes/no (utilitarian/deontological) ; reflects an answer type (no better or worse outcome) Moral permissibility: Likert Scale from 0 to 10 ; reflects an answer type (no better or worse outcome) Subjective emotional reactivity : Likert Scale from 0 to 10 ; reflects an answer type (no better or worse outcome) Subjective emotional r, 3 hours","Explicit time perspective inventory test, Participants indicate, on scales ranging from 1 (not at all) to 5 (completely) their levels of agreement on 10 items assessing their future time perspective (e.g. ""I plan to set many new goals for myself in the future""). A total score is extracted., 3 hours|Implicit time perspective inventory test, Participants are presented with 20 fill-in-the-blank words. These words can be completed either with words referring to future time (""target words""), or with neutral words. The percentage of target words is extracted., 3 hours|Dot Probe Task, This task allows us to assess whether individuals tend to pay more attention to positive or negative information. During the dot-probe task, participants are situated in front of a computer screen and asked to stare at a fixation cross on the center of the screen. Two stimuli, one of which is neutral and one of which is threatening, appear randomly on either side of the screen. The stimuli are presented for a predetermined length of time (most commonly 500ms), before a dot is presented in the location of one former stimulus. Participants are instructed to indicate the location of this dot as quickly as possible, either via keyboard or response box. Latency is measured automatically by the computer. The fixation cross appears again for several seconds and then the cycle is repeated. Quicker reaction time to the dot when it occurs in the previous location of a threatening stimulus is interpreted as vigilance to threat., 3 hours|Level of moral permissibility, This test aims to measure to what extent the participant finds the proposed solution acceptable. For example: How acceptable do you find it to activate the switch in this situation? An 11-point Likert scale is displayed, ranging from ""Not at all"" to ""Absolutely""., 3 hours|Level of emotional reactivity, This test aims to measure the individual's emotional (subjective) reaction to a moral dilemma. For example: What emotion does this situation arouse in you? An 11-point Likert scale is displayed, ranging from ""None"" to ""Intense emotion""., 3 hours|Moral relativity level, This test aims to measure to what extent the participant feels this choice is consensual. For example: Out of 100 people who responded to this scenario, how many would answer as you do? An 11-point Likert scale is displayed below the question, ranging from 0% to 100%., 3 hours|Brief International Cognitive Assessment for Multiple Sclerosis, This test enables the assessment of cognitive disorders. The battery's 3 component tests are as follows:
 
 * California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT): This test is based on a master list of 16 words belonging to 4 distinct semantic categories . The list is presented 5 times, with the patient asked to recall it immediately after each presentation and after a 20-minute delay. A main score is extracted.
 * Brief Visuo-spatial Memory Test (BVMT): This test involves 6 simple geometric drawings. 3 presentation/recall phases follow one another, during which the patient is shown the sheet for 10 seconds, followed by an immediate recall phase. A delayed recall phase (at 7 minutes) is also proposed. A main score is extracted.
 * Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT): a coding test in which the patient has 90 seconds to orally state the correspondence of digits (from 1 to 9) to 9 different symbols (matched according to a correspondence standard). The number of correct answers is measured., 3 hours|The Beck Depression Inventory, This is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, for measuring the severity of depression.
 
 When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-off scores are as follows:
 
 0-9: indicates minimal depression 10-18: indicates mild depression 19-29: indicates moderate depression 30-63: indicates severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms., 3 hours|State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory is one of the first tests to assess both state and trait anxiety separately. Each type of anxiety has its own scale of 20 different questions that are scored.\[10\] Scores range from 20 to 80, with higher scores correlating with greater anxiety., 3 hours|Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)-20, The TAS-20 is a self-report scale that is comprised of 20 items. Items are rated using a 5-point Likert scale whereby 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree. There are 5 items that are negatively keyed (items 4, 5, 10, 18 and 19). The total alexithymia score is the sum of responses to all 20 items, while the score for each subscale factor is the sum of the responses to that subscale. The TAS-20 uses cutoff scoring: equal to or less than 51 = non-alexithymia, equal to or greater than 61 = alexithymia. Scores of 52 to 60 = possible alexithymia., 3 hours|Empathy quotient-8 (EQ-8), This is an 8-item self-questionnaire.

Sclerosis,NCT05820334,Multiple Sclerosis and Fatigue Assessment,https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05820334,Multiple Sclerosis,,"Fatigue Severity, In the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), participants are asked to rate their fatigue level between 1 and 7 in the 9 statements (including motivation, exercise, physical functioning, carrying out duties, and interfering with work, family, or social life) during the last week.The minimum score possible is 9 and the highest is 63. The higher score indicates more severe fatigue., Baseline|Fatigue Impact, The Fatigue Impact Scale (FIS) was first developed by Fisk to evaluate the symptoms of fatigue in disease states and the effects of fatigue on daily life. FIS considers the fatigue in the last month. It consists of 40 questions in total, investigating the effects of fatigue on cognitive (10 questions), physical (10 questions), and psychosocial (20 questions). Since each question is scored between 0 (no problem) and 4 (maximum problem), the total score of the scale is 160, and an increase in the score means that the effect of fatigue increases. Cognitive function, memory, thinking and regulation; physical function motivation, endurance and effort; psychosocial function evaluates the effect of fatigue on emotions, coping and workload based on self-report., Baseline|Fatigue Assessment, ""Checklist Individual Strength"" (CIS) Scale: It was developed by Beurskens and adapted into Turkish by Ergin to measure the general fatigue levels of individuals. It is a valid and reliable fatigue assessment scale in patients with MS. According to this scale, fatigue; subjective perception of fatigue is evaluated in four aspects as decrease in concentration, decrease in motivation and decrease in physical activity. The questionnaire consists of 20 statements measuring the fatigue in the last 2 weeks and a 7-point scale is used for the answers. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 20, and the highest score is 140., Baseline|Cognitive Fatigue Assessment, The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) initiative was undertaken to recommend a brief, cognitive assessment for MS that is optimized for small centers. BICAMS was particularly focused on international use, to facilitate comparison across settings. An expert committee of twelve neurologists and neuropsychologists representing the main cultural groups that have so far contributed extensive data about cognitive dysfunction in MS was convened. The opinions generated from the meeting are published elsewhere. Consensus was also achieved on optimal measures for learning and memory in MS patients, time permitting: the initial learning trials of the second edition of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT2) and the revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMTR)., Baseline|Lower extremity functions, The 25-Step Walking Test is a test that measures lower extremity functions. It has been developed for the purpose of recording the patient with this test at each examination. The patient is asked to walk in a predetermined interval. The average of both times is taken by noting the number of seconds spent on the way out and on the way back., Baseline|Upper extremity functions, Upper extremity function was evaluated with the 9-Hole Peg Test (9-HPT). It consists of moving nine pegs into one of the nine holes on a peg board, then back into an open box. A stopwatch was used for the measurements and the scores were recorded in seconds (s)., Baseline|Hand grip-fatigue assessment, In order to evaluate the fatigue that may occur due to time, the grip muscle strength that individuals can sustain for a certain period of time will be evaluated. A 'K-Force Grip grip dynamometer' will be used for the measurement. The values and fatigue level will be recorded by making three attempts for both hands in the determined position. The test will be administered for 30 seconds. A 1-minute rest will be given between measurements. The average value for fatigue and grip strength will be calculated., Baseline|Muscle strength-fatigue assessment, Fatigue is automatically calculated and reported by the K-Force device. The device software fatigue value is calculated based on the changes in performance during muscle contraction. In the evaluation of muscle strength, the 'K-Force Muscle Controller' will be evaluated using a muscle dynamometer. For the lower extremity, hip flexion, hip abduction, and knee extension will be evaluated bilaterally. Shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction and elbow flexion muscle strength will be evaluated for the upper extremity. In the lower and upper extremities, the measurement will be repeated 3 times for both sides and the average value will be calculated and recorded. A 1-minute rest will be given between measurements. The fatigue value determined for each measurement will also be recorded. Test positions applied during manual muscle testing will be applied to provide standardization for assessment., Baseline|Balance-fatigue assessment, In order to evaluate the fatigue that may occur due to performance, the balance of individuals and the resulting fatigue will be evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale-Fatigue (VAS-F) before and after the balance changes calculated from the device during the balance tests. It will be evaluated using the 'Force Plates' device in the evaluation of balance. Foot sole pressure distributions, ground reaction forces, static and dynamic balance evaluations, symmetry will be evaluated. For static balance; balance on one leg, balance on both legs with eyes open and eyes closed will be evaluated. dynamic balance; will be evaluated by the squat assessment. Measurements will be repeated 3 times and the average value will be calculated and recorded. A 1-minute rest will be given between measurements. The higher scores mean a worse in assessment., Baseline","Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the most commonly used scale to monitor disease stage and assess disability in multiple sclerosis patients. Eight functional systems (FS) are evaluated with EDSS (Visual functions, brain stem functions, pyramidal functions, cerebellar functions, sensory functions, bladder and bowel functions, cerebral functions and other). In addition, gait is also evaluated and a score between 0 (normal neurological status) and 10 (death due to MS) is determined by considering functional system scores and the level of independence of the patient in ambulation., Baseline|Standardized Mini Mental Test, There are 19 items in this test, which consists of 5 main parts: orientation, recording memory, attention and calculation, recall and language. The total score of the test is evaluated out of 30 and 24 points are accepted as the threshold value for the diagnosis of mild dementia.

 The EQ VAS records the respondent's self-rated health on vertical, visual analogue scale with endpoints labelled 'the best health you can imagine' and 'the worst health you can imagine'. Higher scores represent better self-perceived health., Monthly throughout 2 year study duration|Change in Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score, The MG-ADL is a myasthenia gravis-specific 8-item scale, which assesses the severity of the following symptoms: talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing, impairment of ability to brush teeth/comb hair, impairment of ability to rise from a chair, double vision, and eyelid droop. Each of the 8 items has 4 response options; 0 (Mild), 1 (Moderate), 2 (Mild) and 3 (Severe). The MG-ADL total score can be calculated by totalling all 8 items out of a maximum score of 24. A higher score indicates severe impairment., Four times per six months throughout 2 year study duration|Change in Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15-item revised scale (MG-QoL15r) score, The MG-QOL15r is a myasthenia gravis-specific health-related quality of life survey, which assesses the impact of myasthenia gravis over the past few weeks on the following domains: emotions, physical health, self-care, social life, and impact on role. Each of the 15 items has three response options: 0 (Not at all), 1 (Somewhat), and 2 (Very much). The MG-QoL15r total score can be calculated by totalling all 15 items out a maximum score of 30. A higher score indicates severe impairment., Once per six months throughout 2 year study duration|Change in Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score, The HADS is a frequently used self-rating scale developed to assess psychological distress in non-psychiatric patients. It consists of two subscales, Anxiety and Depression. The instrument comprises 14 items, 7 for the anxiety subscale and 7 for the depression subscale. Each item is scored on a 4-point response scale, scale wording changes for each item with each coding response corresponding with greater impairment or severity. Domain scores can be calculated by totalling all 7 items out of a maximum score of 21. High scores indicate greater severity of that impairment, Once per six months throughout 2 year study duration|Change in Health Utilities Index III (HUI3) score, The HUI3 is a generic 8-item survey, which provides descriptive evidence on multiple dimensions of health status, a score for each dimension of health, and a health-related quality of life score for overall health.Health dimensions include vision, hearing, speech, ambulation/mobility, pain, dexterity, emotion and cognition. Each dimension has five or six response options. It has recall periods of either 'usual health', the past week, two weeks, or four weeks. Scores on individual items are combined to given a combined health state which can then be converted to health utilities. Lower health utilities represent worse health., Once per 12 months throughout 2 year study duration|COVID-19 survey results, This is a bespoke survey designed to understand the impact of COVID-19 on study participants. It includes questions about whether participants have had COVID, and the consequences if so, whether they have been vaccinated, and how the wider pandemic has affected their MG treatment and quality of life., Monthly throughout 2 year study duration|Change in Single Simple Question (SSQ) and Patient Acceptable Symptom States (PASS) scores, The SSQ is a single question that asks respondents what percentage of normal they feel with respect to their MG. The PASS is a single question that asks respondents whether they would consider their current disease state to be satisfactory if they had to stay in it for the next few months. The SSQ and PASS will be presented to participants at the same time, as a question pair., Four times per six months throughout 2 year study duration|Change in EuroQol 5-dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3L) score, The EQ-5D-3L is a three-level version of the EQ-5D-5L. It includes the same dimensions as the EQ-5D-5L, but each has only three levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems. The EQ VAS is unchanged from the EQ-5D-5L version., Monthly for three months for participants from the US and Italy only","Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Dyspnea Characteristics score, The PROMIS sleep disturbance measure assesses self-reported frequency, severity, and duration of dyspnea (shortness of breath) over the last 7 days using either a 0-10 numeric rating scale or 0-4 rating scale to assess dyspnea characteristics.Each item is evaluated individually according to the numeric rating scale. No total score is calculated for this instrument. Higher scores on items indicate more severe symptoms., Once per six months throughout 2 year study duration|Change in Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue score, The FACIT-Fatigue measure is a generic 13-item survey which assesses fatigue levels and impact over the past 7 days. The level of fatigue is measured on a 4-point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigue to 0 = very much fatigued). Scores range from 0-52. The higher the score, the better the quality of life., Once per six months throughout 2 year study duration|Change in Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance short form 6a change, The PROMIS sleep disturbance measure assesses self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep over the last 7 days using a 5-point scale.

Each item is graded on a 4- point symptom severity scale (0 = normal, 3 = most severe), with the total score ranging from 0 to 24. Test items emphasize the functional impact of muscle weakness (eg, the ability to comb one's hair or brush one's teeth instead of hand grip or outstretched arm strength tests) rather than its quantitation. The MG-ADL requires no special equipment or training and can be administered in 10 minutes. The MG-ADL test domains include ocular (2 items), oropharyngeal (3 items), respiratory (1 item), and extremity/limb (2 items)., The changes in points from baseline assessment score to 3 months follow up assessment score|Change in MG quality of life 15 (MG-QOL15)., Everyday clinical use led to the development of an abbreviated 15-item version, the MG-QOL15. These 15 items were derived from the mobility (9 items), symptoms (3 items), general contentment (1 item), and emotional well-being (2 items) domains of the 60-item version. Each of the items/statements (eg, ""I have limited my social activity because of my condition"") is scored by patients on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (""not at all"") to 4(""very much"") based on their experience over the previous 4 weeks; the item scores are summed to generate a total score ranging from 0 to 60., The changes in points from baseline assessment score to 3 months follow up assessment score|Change in MG manual muscle testing (MG-MMT)., The MG-MMT assesses the strength or function of 30 muscle groups typically affected by MG and includes a total of 18 items, with 12 assessed bilaterally, and 6 assessed as single items (lid closure, cheek puff, tongue protrusion, jaw closure, neck flexion, and neck extension). Each item is scored on a 5- point severity scale, based on the severity of muscle weakness \[0 = no weakness, 1 = weak/mild (25%) impairment, 2 = weak/moderate (50%) impairment, 3 = weak/severe (75%) impairment, 4 = paralyzed/unable to perform\]. Bilateral scores are summed for a total item score, and all item scores are summed for a total MG-MMT score. MG-MMT scores range from 0 to 120; domains include ocular (3 items, including eyelid closure), facial/oropharyngeal (3 items), axial strength (neck flexion/extension; 2 items), and limb strength (10 items)., The changes in points from baseline assessment score to 3 months follow up assessment score|Change in MG composite (MGC) Score., The MG Composite (MGC) Scale is considered a mixed outcome measure that incorporates both physician-evaluated and patient-reported outcome items. In creating this composite scale, the developers sought to minimize the number of items (and thus administration time), to maximize the sensitivity and clinical relevance of each item, and to weight items (as recommended by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America MGFA task force) commensurate with their impact on functional status, QOL, overall health status, and prognosis.13 The MGC Scale is composed of individual items from outcome measures (including the quantitative myasthenia gravis score (QMG), the MG-ADL, and the MG-MMT).

 For diagnostic models, performance will be described by AUC, Precision, Recall and F1 for each disease class. Predicted disease class will be defined as the highest probability observed across all possible classes. Ground truth will be assigned by pre-defined diagnostic criteria by enrolling site PIs following CMR interpretation with access to medical records.
 
 For prognostic models, algorithm-predicted major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be tested from CMR to first observed MACE. Both regression (time to event) and classification modelling (at 1-year and 2-year time points) will be assessed. Classification performance will be assessed similar to diagnostic models.

Normal blood pressure population are advised to have a normal or low sodium intake. Physical exercise is recommended in both groups.
 
 This registry is a good opportunity to test how important sodium diet is to induce hypertension, or if by the contrary adaptability could prevail over high sodium intake in this registry.

  * Iris cysts;
  * Cystoid macular oedema;
  * Anterior uveitis;
  * Reactivation of herpes simplex virus infection, 1 year|Health economic outcomes, The primary intention of the economic evaluation is to explore the cost associated with TED treatment. In theory, Bimatoprost intervention would lead to the net cost savings to NHS in comparison to surgical rehabilitation that the patient otherwise will go through. We are aware of limitation in the trial design as this trial primary intention is to evaluate efficacy of Bimatoprost in TED, not to follow up patients until they might need surgery. However it would be useful to collect the resource use and quality of life data during this trial period on a pilot basis which may lead to a larger health economic focus study in the future. It is not envisaged that the crossover design will yield data that could allow a meaningful incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to be calculated for Bimatoprost against placebo, as the duration of effects on perceived quality of life cannot be predicted in advance, 1 year",,ALL,"ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE4,"University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, CF14 4XW, United Kingdom","Principal Investigator : Colin M Dayan, MA FRCP PhD , Cardiff University"

An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug-related. An AE could therefore have been any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study treatment., up to approximately Week 108 (Week 52 was the first visit of this Treatment Extension study.)|Trough Plasma Concentrations of Ruxolitinib at Week 80 and Week 104, The steady-state plasma concentration was assessed. Pharmacokinetic blood samples could have been collected at any time prior to study drug application at the site at the Week 80 visit and at any time at the Week 104 (End of Trial) visit. Results from the two parent studies indicated that steady state was reached at or before Week 4, and that, hence, the use of vehicle or ruxolitinib 1.5% in the first 52 weeks of treatment had no impact on the ruxolitinib plasma concentration at the Week 80 and Week 104 (End of Treatment) visits. Thus, the two Cohort B cohorts were combined into a single arm for data analysis in this study., Weeks 80 (predose); Week 104 (any time post-dose) (Week 52 was the first visit of this Treatment Extension study.)",,ALL,"CHILD, ADULT, OLDER_ADULT",PHASE3,"Cahaba Dermatology, Hoover, Alabama, 35244, United States|Desert Sky Dermatology, Gilbert, Arizona, 85295, United States|First Oc Dermatology, Fountain Valley, California, 92708, United States|Center For Dermatology Cosmetic and Laser Surgery, Fremont, California, 94538, United States|Marvel Clinical Research Llc, Huntington Beach, California, 92647, United States|Vitiligo & Pigmentation Institute of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, 90036, United States|Dermatology Research Associates, Los Angeles, California, 90045, United States|Acrc Studies, San Diego, California, 92119, United States|University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California, 94158, United States|Colorado Medical Research Center Inc, Denver, Colorado, 80210, United States|Harmony Medical Research Institute, Hialeah, Florida, 33016, United States|San Marcus Research Clinic Inc., Miami Lakes, Florida, 33014, United States|Advanced Pharma, Miami, Florida, 33147, United States|Leavitt Medical Associates of Florida, Ormond Beach, Florida, 32174, United States|Avita Clinical Research, Tampa, Florida, 33613, United States|Olympian Clinical Research, Tampa, Florida, 33614, United States|Forcare Clinical Research Fcr Forward Clinical Trials, Inc, Tampa, Florida, 33624, United States|Metabolic Research Institute Inc, West Palm Beach, Florida, 33401, United States|Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, 60611, United States|Randall Dermatology, West Lafayette, Indiana, 47906, United States|Delricht Clinical Research - Clinedge - Ppds Baton Rouge, Baton Rouge, Louisiana, 70809, United States|Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02116, United States|Metro Boston Clinical Partners, Brighton, Massachusetts, 02135, United States|Great Lakes Research Group Inc, Bay City, Michigan, 48706, United States|Henry Ford Medical Center, Detroit, Michigan, 48202, United States|Minnesota Clinical Study Center, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 55432, United States|Jdr Dermatology Research, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89148, United States|Suny Downstate Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York, 11203, United States|Forest Hills Dermatology Group, Kew Gardens, New York, 11415, United States|The Dermatology Specialists Greenwich, New York, New York, 10012, United States|Icahn School of Medicine At Mount Sinai, New York, New York, 10029, United States|Derm Research Center of New York Inc, Stony Brook, New York, 11790, United States|Wake Research Associates Llc, Raleigh, North Carolina, 27612, United States|Wake Forest University, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, 27104, United States|Central Sooner Research, Norman, Oklahoma, 73071, United States|Kgl Skin Study Center, Broomall, Pennsylvania, 19008, United States|Dermatology Associates of Plymouth Meeting, Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, 19462, United States|Palmetto Clinical Trial Services, Anderson, South Carolina, 29621, United States|International Clinical Research Tennessee Llc, Murfreesboro, Tennessee, 37130, United States|Innovative Dermatology, Plano, Texas, 75024, United States|Progressive Clinical Research, San Antonio, Texas, 78213, United States|The Dermatology and Laser Center of San Antonio, San Antonio, Texas, 78229, United States|Clinical Research Partners Llc, Richmond, Virginia, 23226, United States|Dermatology Specialists of Spokane, Spokane, Washington, 99202, United States|Medical Center Unimed Eood, Sevlievo, 05400, Bulgaria|Diagnostic Consultative Center Ii Sofia Eood, Sofia, 01000, Bulgaria|University Multiprofile Hospital For Active Treatment Aleksandrovska, Sofia, 01431, Bulgaria|Diagnostic Consultative Center Xxviii - Sofia - Eood, Sofia, 01592, Bulgaria|Medical Center Eurohealth, Sofia, 01606, Bulgaria|Dermatology Research Institute, Calgary, Alberta, T1Y 0B4, Canada|Simcoderm Medical and Surgical Dermatology Center, Barrie, Ontario, L4M 7G1, Canada|Kingsway Clinical Research, Etobicoke, Ontario, M8X 1Y9, Canada|Lynderm Research Inc, Markham, Ontario, L3P 1X2, Canada|Skin Centre For Dermatology, Peterborough, Ontario, K9J 5K2, Canada|K.
